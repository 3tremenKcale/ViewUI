5 axis machining is a technique that involves moving a cutting tool along five different axes simultaneously. This allows you to create complex shapes and features that would be impossible or very difficult with conventional 3 or 4 axis machining. VisualMILL 2012 offers several options for 5 axis machining, such as indexed, continuous, curve projection, flow curve, between 2 curves, drive curve, surface normal and swarf machining[^6^].
 
To use VisualMILL 2012 for 5 axis machining, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create or import a part model in VisualCAD, the CAD module of VisualMILL 2012. You can use various tools to create or modify your geometry, such as curves, surfaces, solids and meshes.
2. Switch to the CAM module of VisualMILL 2012 and select the machine type and post-processor that match your machine. You can choose from hundreds of free post-processors or create your own using the post-processor generator.
3. Define the stock material and the work zero for your part. You can use various methods to define the stock shape and size, such as box, cylinder, extrude curve or from geometry. You can also use various methods to define the work zero location and orientation, such as WCS origin, pick point or align to geometry.
4. Create one or more machining operations for your part. You can use various tools to select the geometry to be machined, such as curves, surfaces, solids or meshes. You can also use various parameters to control the toolpath generation, such as tool type and size, feed and speed rates, clearance plane height, cut direction and stepover.
5. For 5 axis machining operations, you need to specify additional parameters that control the tool axis orientation and movement. These parameters vary depending on the type of 5 axis operation you choose. For example, for indexed machining, you need to specify the index angles for each cut level; for continuous machining, you need to specify the drive surface or curve that guides the tool axis; for curve projection machining, you need to specify the projection plane and the projection curve; and so on.
6. After creating your machining operations, you can simulate them using the toolpath animation or the cut material simulation features. These features allow you to visualize how the tool moves along the part and how the material is removed. You can also use the advanced cut material simulation feature to detect any collisions between the tool, the holder and the part.
7. Once you are satisfied with your machining operations and simulation results, you can generate the G-code for your machine using the post-process feature. You can preview the G-code in a text editor or a backplotter before saving it to a file.
8. Finally, you can transfer the G-code file to your machine controller and run it on your machine.

By following these steps, you can use VisualMILL 2012 for 5 axis machining and create complex parts with high precision and quality. VisualMILL 2012 is one of the most powerful, complete, easy-to-use and affordable CAM systems in the market today. You can download a free demo version from MecSoft's website[^5^] and try it yourself.
