If you are a music producer or a audio engineer, you might have encountered the problem of incompatible VST plugins in your host software. For example, you might have some 32-bit plugins that you want to use in a 64-bit host, or vice versa. Or you might have some plugins that consume too much memory and cause your host to crash.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem: Jbridge 1.6. Jbridge is an application designed for bridging VST plugins in Windows (up to the 2.4 VST specification). Using inter-process communication mechanisms, it aims to make it possible to run 32-bit plugins in 64-bit hosts, 64-bit plugins in 32-bit hosts, or even bridging 32-bit plugins to 32-bit hosts, allowing to overcome the memory limitations of a single 32-bit process[^1^].

Here you can adjust various options such as performance mode, GUI options, compatibility options, etc. You can also enable or disable notifications, logging, and automatic updates. For more details on each option, you can refer to the user manual[^4^] or the online help.
 
One important option that you need to set is the "VST plugins folder(s) to scan" option. This is where you tell Jbridge where your VST plugins are located on your computer. You can add multiple folders by clicking on the "+" button. You can also exclude some folders or files by clicking on the "-" button.

 ![Jbridger window](https://4download.net/uploads/posts/2021-03/1616714607_jbridge-174-full-version-2.jpg) 
Here you can see a list of all your VST plugins that Jbridge has scanned from the folders that you specified in the settings. You can sort them by name, type (32-bit or 64-bit), size, date, etc. You can also filter them by keywords or categories.
 
To bridge a plugin, you just need to select it from the list and click on "Bridge". Jbridge will create a bridged version of the plugin in the same folder as the original one, with a different extension (.dll32 for bridging 64-bit plugins to 32-bit hosts, .dll64 for bridging 32-bit plugins to 64-bit hosts). You can also bridge multiple plugins at once by selecting them with Ctrl or Shift keys and clicking on "Bridge selected".
 
Alternatively, you can also use the drag-and-drop method to bridge your plugins. You just need
